You are a senior frontend engineer and UI designer.

I already have a working Next.js 14 + TypeScript + App Router project for a resume analysis app using Firebase + Gemini. The logic and pages exist (landing, auth, dashboard, analysis/new, analysis/[id]), but the UI is basic. 

Your task: REFINE AND UPGRADE THE EXISTING UI INTO A FUTURISTIC, MODERN, MINIMAL DESIGN with smooth transitions and micro-interactions, WITHOUT breaking the existing logic.

### Tech & Styling Constraints
- Use **Tailwind CSS** (assume it is already configured).
- Prefer a **dark, futuristic theme** with high contrast, neon accents, and lots of whitespace.
- Use **rounded-2xl / 3xl cards**, subtle **glassmorphism** (blurred backgrounds), and soft shadows.
- Use **Framer Motion** for transitions and animations where appropriate.
- Keep everything **responsive** (mobile-first, then desktop).

### Global Design System
1. **Colors (example – you can tweak intelligently):**
   - Background: very dark (e.g. `#020617`, `#030712`)
   - Surface: slightly lighter panels (e.g. `#020617` → `#0b1120`)
   - Accent: neon cyan / purple (e.g. `#22d3ee`, `#a855f7`)
   - Text: neutral (`text-slate-100`, `text-slate-400`)

2. **Typography:**
   - Use a clean sans-serif (e.g. Inter). 
   - Clear hierarchy: page titles `text-3xl/4xl font-semibold`, section titles `text-xl/2xl`, body `text-sm/md`.
   - Keep things minimal, no cluttered text.

3. **Layout:**
   - Create a **max-w-5xl** or **max-w-6xl** centered content layout.
   - Use consistent `padding` and `gap` across sections (e.g. `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8`).
   - Use a grid / flex layout for dashboard cards.

4. **Components:**
   Refactor or create reusable components in `components/`:
   - `LayoutShell` or `AppShell` component:
     - Full-height background gradient / subtle animated background.
     - Centered content with max width.
   - `Navbar`:
     - Left: app logo / name (e.g. “ResumePilot AI” or similar).
     - Right: subtle pill-shaped user menu and Logout button.
   - `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton`:
     - Rounded-full or rounded-xl.
     - Hover + focus states with scale and glow.
   - `Card`:
     - Glassmorphism style (backdrop-blur, border, gradient border or glow).
   - `StatBadge` / `ScoreBadge`:
     - Used to display resume match score with a gradient background and small animation.
   - `SectionHeader`:
     - Title + optional description, consistent across pages.

### Animations & Transitions (Framer Motion)
- Add **page transitions**:
  - Fade + slight upward motion when pages mount.
- Add **card hover effects**:
  - Slight scale-up and shadow / border-glow on hover.
- Add smooth **button interactions**:
  - Scale + subtle glow on hover and tap.
- For lists (like analyses on the dashboard), use **staggered animations** when they appear.

### Page-Specific UI Requirements

1. **`/` (Landing Page)**
   - Hero section:
     - Catchy headline about AI-powered resume + job matching.
     - Short subheading.
     - Two buttons: “Get Started” (primary) and “Learn more” (secondary).
   - Background:
     - Subtle animated gradient or particles effect (can be simple CSS animation).
   - Include a small 3-step “How it works” section with icons / simple cards.

2. **`/auth` (Login / Signup)**
   - Centered auth card with tabs/toggles for Login / Signup.
   - Big, friendly heading (“Welcome back” / “Create an account”).
   - Clean form fields:
     - Use labels, placeholders, and subtle focus rings.
   - Show error/success states as small colored text or alert strips inside the card.
   - Add a soft entrance animation for the card.

3. **`/dashboard`**
   - Welcome header with user’s email or name.
   - Main layout:
     - Left: “New Analysis” call-to-action card.
     - Right: list/grid of previous analyses.
   - Each analysis card:
     - Show job title, company, created date.
     - Prominent score badge with gradient.
     - Hover animation and click to open detail page.
   - Optional: simple filters or search bar at the top.

4. **`/analysis/new`**
   - Page title and short description at the top.
   - Place resume + job details in a **two-column layout** on desktop, stacked on mobile:
     - Column 1: Job Title, Company, Job Description textarea.
     - Column 2: Resume textarea (for now) with monospace styling and subtle background.
   - “Analyze Resume” button anchored at the bottom of the form section, full-width on mobile.
   - On submit, show a loading state:
     - Animated loading indicator with text like “Analyzing with Gemini…”.

5. **`/analysis/[id]`**
   - Show a header with job title, company, and created date.
   - Display score at the top in a large circular or pill-shaped score component.
   - Use cards for:
     - Feedback summary.
     - Interview questions (list with bullet icons or numbered).
     - Application questions.
   - Add copy-to-clipboard icons next to each question group.
   - Enter animation: staggered cards sliding/fading in.

### Implementation Instructions
- DO NOT change existing Firebase and Gemini business logic, only **wrap or restyle** components.
- Where needed, refactor JSX into smaller, well-named components and place them under `components/`.
- Add/adjust Tailwind utility classes, and update `globals.css` if necessary for base styles (background, font, scrollbars).
- Add Framer Motion:
  - Install dependency if not present (`framer-motion`).
  - Use it in page components and key reusable UI components (cards, buttons).

### Output
Update the existing project files directly:
- Layout and page components under `app/`
- Create or update components under `components/`
- Optionally adjust `app/layout.tsx` and `app/globals.css` for global styling.

Keep your changes cohesive and consistent so that when I run `npm run dev`, the app looks like a polished, futuristic, production-ready UI while retaining all existing functionality.
